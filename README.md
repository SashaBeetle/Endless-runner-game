# Endless-runner-game
2DGame

 This is a little game I made together with my friends.
 Since this is a small project, you will not see it here Object-oriented programming, Frameworks and other.
 We divided the tasks as follows:

#### Oleksandr Zakala [Git](https://github.com/Rovikido)
1. Find and add sprites
2. Unique speed for enemies
3. Increasing complexity
4. Game over screen
#### Oleksandr Zhuk [Git](https://github.com/SashaBeetle)
1. Create form and timer systems
2. Spawn Enemys and Stars
3. Control and create player
4. Score
#### Synytskyi Vitalii [Git](https://github.com/VitaliySynytskyi)
1. Spawn road marking
2. Collision
3. Map borders
4. Restart game
